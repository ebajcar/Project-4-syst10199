# Instructions
## Introduction
The web app we are constructing this semester is a website for members only that will allow general public to become a member of "Gaming Cats' Clubhouse" site. The members will have access to some of the games we develop throughout the semester.

We use the Progressive Enhancement (PE) approach to complete each project. The PE process consists of three phases:
-   **Phase I:**  Build solid foundation with HTML5. Identify content and use the most suitable (meaningful) markup to organize it. All content must be accessible without styles.
-   **Phase II:**  Using well-formed and valid HTML5, style the elements for best presentation. All content must be accessible without scripts.
-   **Phase III:**  Using well-formed and valid HTML5 styled with well-formed and valid CSS3, add behaviour with Javascript.
